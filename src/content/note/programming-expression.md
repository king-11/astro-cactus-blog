>This is what's crucial to understand programming for programmers
who like to code is not just about the
programs they get out of it. That may be the economic value. It's not the only human value. The human value is just
much in the expression.

This quote from the [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=oXHjuRuKhfs_ZRQR&v=vagyIcmIGOQ&feature=youtu.be) between Lex Fridman and DHH resonated with me a lot. Programming isn't just work for many of us it's a hobby, something which we find joyful.

It's the *_"Joy of Programming_"* that makes us want to do things and learn rather than offloading everything to AI.
